# Generics-Design-Specification

The benefits of this generic design in comparison to alternative designs
•	Stronger type checks at compile time.
A Java compiler applies strong type checking to generic code and issues errors if the code violates type safety. Fixing compile-time errors is easier than fixing runtime errors, which can be difficult to find.

•	Elimination of casts.
There is no need for explicit type casting when we use generics.

•	Enabling programmers to implement generic algorithms.
By using generics, programmers can implement generic algorithms that work on collections of different types, can be customized, and are type safe and easier to read.
